      <description>What is this blog for? The purpose of this blog is to document things that I consider important while learning/doing things related to binary exploitation, hardware security, and exploit development. I am currently a SOC analyst, but aspire to either enter the field of exploit development/red teaming. Feel free to use any of the information here to help you understand these concepts, and hopefully I can get a CVE or two along the way ;)</description>
