      <description>Backstory Recently, to begin my journey in exploit development, I&amp;rsquo;ve been honing skills I never thought I would revisit after failing my first programming class over a decade ago. To be fair, it was C++. I have been combing over lessons about memory, registers, binary, hex, and assembly. While these topics are not exactly fascinating, they are mandatory to know before entering the exploit development sphere.&#xA;I am a member of a cybersecurity community known as Elevate Cyber, and one of the workshops that the creator, Ryan, has made is focused on low-level computing.</description>

      <description>What is this blog for? The purpose of this blog is to document things that I consider important while learning/doing things related to binary exploitation, hardware security, and exploit development. I am currently a SOC analyst, but aspire to either enter the field of exploit development/red teaming. Feel free to use any of the information here to help you understand these concepts, and hopefully I can get a CVE or two along the way ;)</description>
